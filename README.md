A web interactive US map was built to show straw polls for 2020 Presidential Election and each state political status.

# Data Source

# Data Cleaning

# Database and backend server

We used SQL database in Postgres to store the data and used SQLAlchemy to create a flask server to load the data into Python.

# Frontend visualization

We used html, D3, Javascript, Plotly, JQuery, Leaflet and Choropleth to build our final visualization dashboard.

# Interactive Website includes:

* US map with state colored based on the majority poll
