                    <h4><u>Strategy</u></h4>
                    <p>The Biden campaign is poised to get the win come November 2020, They have a great stronghold of states that have a consistent democratic voting record. With the addition of these electoral votes Biden is sitting comfortable at 182 Electoral votes, putting him 88 votes away from winning the election.
                         If the campaign can meet this criteria they can all but guarantee a win for the candidate this coming November.</p>
                    <h6>Smart Geo-Tracking-</h6>
                    <p>The Obama Campaign in 2012 was one of the first campaigns to incorporate Big Data in the voting turnout process.
                        They focused on the movement of
                        votes in the last week of the election and shifted advertisement money to areas in need. The Clinton campaigned failed to understand the 
                        use of Big Data early and were too late to shift advertising money to the needed states. The Biden campaign 
                       need to keep a close on the shift of support is key battleground states and shift advertisement money where it is needed most.</p></p>
                    <h6>Stay Negative-</h6>
                    <p>President Trump is arming the democratic campaign with all the ammunition it needs. The Biden 
                        Campaign needs to stay negative on this administration’s ineffective leadership in this pandemic but continuing to showcase death 
                        counts and infection counts. The campaign is betting that Biden’s method of responding to the coronavirus — preaching the need 
                        for social distancing and mask-wearing while talking about unity and empathy — will contrast sharply with Trump, who has 
                        refused to wear a mask in public, downplayed the threat of the pandemic’s duration and doesn’t spend much time expressing 
                        sympathy for the nearly 122,000 Americans who died from Covid-19. Along with the pandemic, the campaign needs to highlight 
                        the growing animosity that is being caused by this administration. Staying negative is easy, but the Biden campaign needs 
                        to make sure they are backing up their statements with factual evidence. </p>
                    <h6>Limit Debates</h6>
                    <p>Joe Biden, despite being a great leader, is the king of malaprops. He often mistakenly uses an 
                        incorrect word in the place of a word with a similar sound resulting in a nonsensical utterance. The campaign 
                        needs to limit the amount of debates. If Biden is seen consistently mixing up words, he will be perceived as 
                        old and incapable of leading the nation. The Presidential voice is a big part of the voters decision.</p>
                    <h6>BattleGround States</h6>
                    <p>The Campaign needs to focus on 4 States to ensure a democratic victory. 
                        The campaign needs to focus its Ad spend in these states and ride the momentum the candidate currently retains.</p>
