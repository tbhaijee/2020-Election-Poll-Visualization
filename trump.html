                <h4><u>Strategy</u></h4>
                <p>The Trump campaign has its work cut out for them. The actions the administration has taken to combat the current pandemic and the racial divide has led the voters to believe Donald Trump cannot lead this country out of these trying times.</p>
                <h6>Battleground States-</h6>
                <p>The Trump Campaign has to put all of its focus and AD buy in these Key Battleground states. Along with Joe Biden, they have to focus on Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona. The one state that the Trump campaign has to focus on is
                    Florida, without those 29 electoral votes, it is virtually impossible for another Trump Administration. In order to win the election, President Trump has to win all of the battleground states.</p>
                <h6>Covid-19/ Economy -</h6>
                <p>To state the obvious: A coronavirus cure would help (not that he would have anything to do with it), as would clear evidence that the economy is on the mend. President Trump needs to hold himself accountable for the way the administration
                    responded to the pandemic and put data in the forefront of the battle. The administration needs to bring back Dr. Fauci and make the President the face of the battle. Along with this they need to enforce a national mask decree to slowdown
                    the progress before the first debate. Trump can hope that voters don’t blame him for the economic shutdown. He’s blames the governors, which is largely true, but if that’s the case, then the president is throwing two swing-state Republicans
                    under the bus: Florida’s Ron DeSantis and Arizona’s Doug Ducey. The president could also try to convince voters that his tariffs and trade wars have been a good thing. But tariff is just another word for taxes on the end user, and
                    there’s plenty of data that adds to the president’s vulnerability.</p>
                <h6>Increased Negative Campaigning</h6>
                <p>Trump also has another, often ignored disadvantage. Many of his 2016 voters weren’t so much voting for him as they were voting against Hillary Clinton. The percentage of Americans who have a “very negative” view of Biden is about 25%,
                    whereas Clinton’s at this point in 2016 was about 42%. Trump has failed to paint “Sleepy Joe” as a monster the way he did “Crooked Hillary,” and I suspect he won’t be able to. I think the best path for Trump, sadly, may be to do what
                    he does best: go dirty. He has admitted that he can’t win with mail-in balloting, so what does Trump (who votes by mail himself) do? He claims it’s rife with fraud. This is a huge lie. There have also been state-level efforts to purge
                    voter rolls and reduce the number of polling places, measures that disproportionately hurt minority voters. Trump squawked that 2016 was rigged (until he won), and we’re beginning to hear similar talk again. And even though Trump seems
                    to think that the coronavirus has gone away, the fact is it could cause problems like understaffed polling places, leading to long lines and chaos.</p>
